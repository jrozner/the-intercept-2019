## Case Fabrication Information (contains spoilers)

These are the top and bottom pieces for the enclosure around the PCB. They were
printed using PLA for the contest specifically to avoid issues with solvents
disolving the plastic while attempting to remove the tamper evident seals. PETG
is also a good choice but you should avoid using ABS as aceton will react badly
with it.

The hardware to screw the pieces together are M2 screws and you'll want to pick
up some matching threaded inserts to press into the plastic.
